# Introduction

## Fast, Accurate Weather Data at Your Fingertips

OpenWeather provides precise weather data by leveraging trusted sources such as weather stations, satellites, radar systems, and advanced models including GFS, ECMWF, and our proprietary OWHL™️. 

Through partnerships with the UK Met Office and other national meteorological agencies, we deliver data updates every 10 minutes, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

Notably, our OWHL™️ model reports **less than 1%** of temperature predictions deviating by more than 5°C, making us one of the most dependable providers of short-term forecasts worldwide.
